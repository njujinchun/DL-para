This is a PyTorch implementation of deep learning (DL)-based parameterization model for effectively representing the heterogeneous geological parameter fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. The DL-based parameterization method generates a low-dimensional representation of the non-Gaussian permeability fields with multi- and intra-facies heterogeneity in a geological carbon storage (GCS) problem. Once trained, the DL model's decoder is able to produce a non-Gaussian permeability field given an arbitrary low-dimensional latent vector as input. This DL-based parameterization strategy can then be integrated with inverse algorithms to estimate the heterogeneous non-Gaussian permeability field, thereby enhancing the characterization of $CO_2$ plume migration in the aquifer.

### Three original log-permeability field realizations (a-c), histograms of DL model-encoded latent variables (d-f), the DL model reconstructed log-permeability fields (g-i) and three random log-permeability field realizations generated by the DL modelâ€™s decoder given inputs drawn from the standard normal distribution (j-l)
